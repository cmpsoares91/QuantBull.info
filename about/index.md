About the QuantBull.info Blog
===

The QuantBul.info blog serves as an online development and change log for the QuantBull Project, the Bachelor of Computer Engineering (Licenciatura de Engenharia Informatica)'s final project, attended at the academic institute, **Instituto Superior Manuel Teixeira Gomes**, in which we propose the development of an web application that would overcome difficulties we and many others encounter when trying to start developing trading/investment algorithms, making its development and testing easier, more collaborative and interactive.
